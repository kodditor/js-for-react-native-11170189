# DCIT 202 assignment submission
## Kwabena Owusu-Darko ( 11170189 )

This assignment was created to give us a brief refresher of the javascript language.
Descriptions for the various tasks are listed below.


### Task One
This task required us to create the processArrays function in the arrayManipulation file.
The function takes in an array of numbers, then squares the number when it is even or triples the number when it is odd.
It then returns a new array containing the results of the operations.

### Task Two
This task involved the creation of the formatStrings function, which takes in two arrays, a string array and a number array, then modifies each string based on the corresponding number. If the number is even, the string is capitalized. If the number is odd, the string is converted to lowercase.

### Task Three 
This task involved the creation of the createUserProfiles function in the userInfo.js file which took an array of names and modified names from task two and returned an array of object with fields: originalName, modifiedName and id.

### Task Four
This involved the creation of this readme file : )
